Transfer Student

### More Information
I am a local San Luis Obispo resident and first-generation college student. I am currently working toward a bachelor's degree in biochemistry and plan on pursuing a clinical laboratory scientist license for my post baccalaureate studies. In this capacity I will be able to use my passion for microbiology and medicine to help people overcome disease. 

 I see myself as a lifelong learner and have the desire to pursue higher degrees relating to disease studies. I enjoy continually evolving and strive to be a better person in all aspects of my life.  

I have had the privilege of working over the at a local biotechnology company in the lab in 2018. The company sells monoclonal antibodies to research organizations. In this capacity I learned about different tests one can perform (namely gel electrophoresis and western blot) to test the quality of antibodies. I recently have gotten interested in biotechnology in the field of researching/curing disease. 

This summer I am seeking an internship in Cal Poly’s College of Science and Mathematics in areas relating to antibiotic resistance in microorganisms, chemotherapy agents, biological probes and more.
Other than education, I enjoy: 

Hiking 

My favorite hike is at Hearst San Simeon State Beach (“the cove” as the locals call it). It has a 	hike through a forest of pine and eucalyptus trees culminating at a point with a great view of the 	ocean. 

Biking  

Camping/exploring 

I have found that California has MANY wonderful places to camp and explore. One of my 	aspirations is to camp in each of the 9 California national parks as well as across the country. 

Yoga 

Cooking (especially vegetarian and vegan dishes) 

Reading 

I read mostly nonfiction and am currently reading a biography Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA by, Brenda Maddox. 

 I believe there is much to learn by reflecting on history and it is empowering to read about the accomplishments/ trials of figures from the past. Currently I have a list of books I want to read. My top three are: 

On Food and Cooking by, Harold McGee (a food science writer) 

The Transforming Principle: Discovering that Genes are Made of DNA by, Maclyn McCarty 

The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA by, James D. Watson
