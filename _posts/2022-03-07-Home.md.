I am a local San Luis Obispo resident and first-generation college student. I am currently working toward a bachelor's degree in biochemistry and plan on pursuing a clinical laboratory scientist license for my post baccalaureate studies. In this capacity I will be able to use my passion for microbiology and medicine to help people overcome disease. 

I see myself as a lifelong learner and have the desire to pursue higher degrees relating to disease studies. I enjoy continually evolving and strive to be a better person in all aspects of my life.  

I have had the privilege of working over the at a local biotechnology company in the lab in 2018. The company sells monoclonal antibodies to research organizations. In this capacity I learned about different tests one can perform (namely gel electrophoresis and western blot) to test the quality of antibodies. I recently have gotten interested in biotechnology in the field of researching/curing disease. 

This summer I am seeking an internship in Cal Polyâ€™s College of Science and Mathematics in areas relating to antibiotic resistance in microorganisms, chemotherapy agents, biological probes and more.
